# Capabilities Package

Capabilities package provides Capabilities API that offers the ability to query a cluster's capabilities.
A "capability" is defined as anything a Kubernetes cluster can do or have, such as objects, and the API surface area.
Capability discovery can be used to answer questions such as `Is this a TKG cluster?`, `Does this cluster have a 
resource Foo?` etc.
