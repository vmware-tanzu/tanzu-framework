# Tanzu Framework

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework)

## Overview

Tanzu Framework provides a set of building blocks to build on top of the [Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu)
platform.

Framework provides APIs and Packages that enables Tanzu Kubernetes clusters to function in an enterprise-ready way.

Framework leverages [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) packaging and plugins to provide users with a much stronger, more
integrated experience than the loose coupling and stand-alone commands of the previous generation of tools.
