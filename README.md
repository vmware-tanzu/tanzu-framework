# Tanzu Framework

## What is Framework?

Framework is both the foundation for Tanzu editions and a set of
building blocks that can be used to extend Tanzu. Framework enables
APIs, code, and documentation to be shared.

This model provides a few primary benefits.

* Enables re-use of existing work in Tanzu editions.
* Improvements to Framework benefit all editions.
* Fosters cross-team collaboration.
* Allows extensions to Tanzu to be built following the same patterns as
  components of Tanzu.

## Features

* [Tanzu CLI and core Plugins](docs/cli/commands/)
* [Capabilities API](apis/run/v1alpha1/capability_types.go)
* [Features](apis/config/v1alpha1/feature_types.go) and [FeatureGates](apis/config/v1alpha1/featuregate_types.go) APIs
* [CLI development and build tools](docs/cli/cli-architecture.md)
* [Controllers development resources](docs/api-machinery/)
* [User and developer documentation and guides](docs/dev/)
* [Tanzu Kubernetes Release API](apis/run/v1alpha1/tanzukubernetesrelease_types.go)
* [Tanzu Addons](addons/)
