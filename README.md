# Tanzu Framework

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework)

## Overview

Tanzu Framework provides a set of building blocks to build atop of the [Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu) platform, which includes the following:

* **API Machinery:** For defining and implementing APIs and their controllers
* **CLI Machinery:** For extending the command line experience
* **Packages:** For consistent delivery of core and optional components

Framework leverages [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) packaging and plugins to provide users with a much stronger, more integrated experience than the loose coupling and stand-alone commands of the previous generation of tools.

## Documentation

The [documentation](docs) provides a getting started guide and information about building from source, the Tanzu Framework architecture, extending the Tanzu platform, and more.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with Tanzu Framework is by using the CLI. Please see our getting started with the CLI [guide](docs/cli/getting-started.md) for more details.
