                  Stability levels are Work In Progress, Experimental, Technical Preview,
                  Stable and Deprecated. - Work In Progress: Feature is still under
                  development. It is not ready to be used, except by the team working
                  on it. Activating this feature is not recommended under any circumstances.
                  - Experimental: Feature is not ready, but may be used in pre-production
                  environments. However, if an experimental feature has ever been
                  used in an environment, that environment will not be supported.
                  Activating an experimental feature requires you to permanently,
                  irrevocably void all support guarantees for this environment by
                  setting permanentlyVoidAllSupportGuarantees in feature reference
                  in featuregate spec to true. You will need to recreate the environment
                  to return to a supported state. - Technical Preview: Feature is
                  not ready, but is not believed to be dangerous. The feature itself
                  is unsupported, but activating a technical preview feature does
                  not affect the support status of the environment. - Stable: Feature
                  is ready and fully supported - Deprecated: Feature is destined for
                  removal, usage is discouraged. Deactivate this feature prior to
                  upgrading to a release which has removed it to validate that you
                  are not still using it and to prevent users from introducing new
                  usage of it.'
