# Release notes process

This document provides guidance on how to gather release notes from the pull
requests that have user-visible changes that will be part of the release.

We would be using a tool called [release-notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/cmd/release-notes)
that is responsible for fetching, contextualizing, and rendering the release
notes for Tanzu Framework.

## Installation

The simplest way to install the release-notes CLI is via `go install`:

```sh
go install k8s.io/release/cmd/release-notes@v0.13.0
```

## Usage

To generate release notes for a commit range, we would be needing some basic
information that we need to pass to the `release-notes` command.

* GitHub API token.
* Branch or tag name.
* The commit hash to start processing from (inclusive).
* The commit hash to end processing at (inclusive).

Then run the below command to generate the release notes for a commit range:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_API_TOKEN}
release-notes \
    --github-base-url https://github.com \
    --org vmware-tanzu-private \
    --repo core \
    --branch ${tag_or_branch} \
    --required-author "" \
    --start-sha ${start_sha} \
    --end-sha ${end_sha}
```

The above command writes the release notes to a file that will be printed in
output of this command. The contents of the generated file should be pasted in
release description when publishing the release.
