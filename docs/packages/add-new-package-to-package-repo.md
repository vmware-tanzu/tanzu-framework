# Add a package to management package repository

This document provides guidance on how to add a package to a package repository and test it.
Check this [doc](./definitions.md) before going further, to understand some packaging terminology and to understand the
requirements of a package being in a particular package repository.

## Steps to add a package to a package repository

Let's take the example of adding a package to `management` package repository.
Below are steps to illustrate how that can be done.

1. Scaffold a new package and update the package files

   ```shell
      PACKAGE_NAME=my-package make create-package
   ```

   This would scaffold the package under the `packages` directory, and the tree structure of the generated package
   would look something like below:

   ```plain
    packages/my-package
    ├── Makefile
    ├── README.md
    ├── bundle
    │   ├── config
    │   │   ├── overlay
    │   │   ├── upstream # This is the directory to add the package contents using ytt templates.
    │   │   └── values.yaml # Package contents can be configured by providing data values in this file.
    ├── vendir.yml # To fetch config files from a different data source.
    ├── metadata.yaml # To provide high level information description about your package.
    └── package.yaml # Update the Package CR spec to add/modify fields such as releaseNotes etc.
   ```

   After scaffolding the package, the files in your package directory should be updated with the package config.
   Significance of each file is provided in the above tree structure.

   The generated Makefile contains `configure-package` and `reset-package` target to configure the package dynamically,
   which is completely optional.

2. Fetch config files from datasource [optional]

   If you have updated the vendir.yaml to fetch the config from a different source, run

   ```shell
      make package-vendir-sync
   ```

3. Update kbld-config.yaml [optional]

   If the container image in your config needs to be replaced by an image at build time, add an entry like below in the
   kbld-config.yaml file in `packages` directory.

   ```yaml
       - image: my-package-manager:latest
         newImage: ""
   ```

4. Update COMPONENTS variable in Makefile [optional]

   If the component needs to have a docker image built is in this repo, append the `COMPONENTS` variable with directory
   path that contains a Makefile with `docker-build`, `docker-publish` and `kbld-image-replace` targets that can build
   and push a docker image for that component. ([example Makefile](../../featuregate/Makefile))

5. Update package-values.yaml to add your package details

   `package-values.yaml` contains Ytt data values for all packages and package repositories.

   Add an entry like below to package-values.yaml under `repositories.<packageRepository>.packages`.

   ```yaml
         #! package name
       - name: my-package
         #! Relative path to package bundle
         path: packages/my-package
         domain: tanzu.vmware.com
         version: latest
         #! this should be name:version(my-package:latest), will be replaced at build time
         sha256: "my-package:latest"
   ```

6. Test the package and bundle generation

   Follow this [document](dev-workflow.md) to test the package and repo bundle generation and how to test those artifacts.

Example:

* [Commit](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework/pull/975/commits/6bd7d7645f51f90bdcf895dd0560c0ade71527cc)
  adds a new package to management package repository.
