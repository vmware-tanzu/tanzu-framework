## Management package

Management packages are purpose-built to be installed on the management cluster.

Example: Featuregates, addons-manager, etc.

## Management package repository

A management package repository is a repository for packages that are exclusively intended to be installed on a
management cluster.

## Meta package

A Package that contains PackageInstall CRs, Secrets and ServiceAccounts, RBAC rules that are needed to install other
packages and when the meta package is installed, it installs the other packages. A meta Package may describe
a specific version of a Distribution.
