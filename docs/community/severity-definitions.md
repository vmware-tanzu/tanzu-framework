This document provides definitions for various severity levels of the support
program.

## Severity 1
Critical issue that severely impacts the use of the software, and the situation
halts your operations.

1. No procedural workaround exists.
2. Data corrupted or lost.
3. A critical documented feature/function is not available.


## Severity 2
Major functionality is impacted, or significant performance degradation is
experienced. The situation is causing a high impact to portions of your
operations and no reasonable workaround exists.

1. Service is operational but highly degraded performance to the point of major 
   impact on usage.

   workaround; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion.


## Severity 3

medium-to-low impact, but your operations continues to function. A
short-term workaround is available, but not scalable.
