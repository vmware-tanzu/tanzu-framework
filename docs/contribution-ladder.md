and how to move from interested user to a reviewer.

community:

* Comment on an issue that you are interested in.
* Submit a pull request to fix an issue.
* Review pull requests.
* Report a bug.
* Participate in the discussion in GitHub issues, slack, etc.

To become a contributor, one must have read the [contributor guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
and have made multiple contributions to the project such as authoring or
reviewing PRs, opening issues with bugs, questions, etc, or commenting on
issues with your experiences and opinions. Contributors and maintainers will
do their best to watch for community participants who may make good
contributors to promote them.

willing to be a reviewer. To become a reviewer you need to be nominated by a
maintainer.
