## tanzu test completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(test completion zsh); compdef _test test

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	test completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_test"

#### macOS:

	test completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_test

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```
