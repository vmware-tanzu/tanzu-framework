## tanzu package completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(package completion zsh); compdef _package package

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	package completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_package"

#### macOS:

	package completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_package

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
