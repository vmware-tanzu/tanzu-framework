# Tanzu Command Line Interface (CLI) Getting Started

A simple set of instructions to set up and use the `tanzu` CLI and plugins.

## CLI binary and plugins installation

### Supported Platforms

Following are the combinations supported for CLI

| OS      | Architecture |
| :-----: | :----------: |
| Linux   |    amd64     |
| macOS   |    amd64     |
| Windows |    amd64     |

### Install the latest release of Tanzu CLI

#### Recommended method to install plugins (with API-driven plugin discovery activated)

With [v0.14.0](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework/releases/tag/v0.14.0) release, the artifacts are better categorized and published to allow users to download and configure per recommended and alternate methods.

The API driven plugin discovery feature is enabled as default method to install the plugins. So, most users will just need to install the Tanzu CLI binary. The plugins can be installed and configured with `tanzu plugin sync` command. Learn more about this feature in the [design docs](../design/context-aware-plugin-discovery-design.md).

##### macOS/Linux

###### Option 1: Manual download CLI binary from GitHub Releases

- Download the latest tanzu-cli tarball from [release](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework/releases/latest) page (`tanzu-cli-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` or `tanzu-cli-linux-amd64.tar.gz`)

- Extract the downloaded tar file

  - for macOS:

    ```sh
    mkdir tanzu && tar -zxvf tanzu-cli-darwin-amd64.tar.gz -C tanzu
    ```

  - for Linux:

    ```sh
    mkdir tanzu && tar -zxvf tanzu-cli-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C tanzu
    ```

- Install the `tanzu` CLI

  Note: Replace `v0.14.0` with the version you've downloaded.

  - for macOS:

    ```sh
    install tanzu/v0.14.0/tanzu-core-darwin_amd64 /usr/local/bin/tanzu
    ```

  - for Linux:

    ```sh
    sudo install tanzu/v0.14.0/tanzu-core-linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/tanzu
    ```

- Install the available plugins

  ```sh
  tanzu plugin sync
  ```

- Verify installed plugins

  ```sh
  tanzu plugin list
  ```
  
###### Option 2: Using install script

You may download and install a release using the provided remote script piped into bash.

```shell
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw" \
    -L https://api.github.com/repos/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework/contents/hack/fetch-install-tf.sh | \
    bash -s
```

- This script requires `curl`,`grep`,`tr` and `jq` in order to work.
- The release will be downloaded to a temporary directory and then installation will proceed using the downloaded `tanzu` CLI binary.
- _Note_: A GitHub personal access token may be provided to the script as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. This bypasses GitHub API rate limiting but is not required. Follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to acquire and use a personal access token.

##### Windows

- Download the latest `tanzu-cli-windows-amd64.zip` from [release](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework/releases/latest) page

- Open PowerShell as an administrator, change to the download directory and run:

  ```sh
  Expand-Archive tanzu-cli-windows-amd64.zip -DestinationPath tanzu
  cd .\tanzu\
  ```

- Save following in `install.bat` in current directory and run `install.bat`

  Note: Replace `v0.11.0` (line number 3) with the version you've downloaded.

  ```sh
  SET TANZU_CLI_DIR=%ProgramFiles%\tanzu
  mkdir "%TANZU_CLI_DIR%"
  copy /B /Y v0.11.0\tanzu-core-windows_amd64.exe "%TANZU_CLI_DIR%\tanzu.exe"
  set PATH=%PATH%;%TANZU_CLI_DIR%
  SET PLUGIN_DIR=%LocalAppData%\tanzu-cli
  mkdir %PLUGIN_DIR%
  SET TANZU_CACHE_DIR=%LocalAppData%\.cache\tanzu
  rmdir /Q /S %TANZU_CACHE_DIR%
  tanzu plugin sync
  tanzu plugin list
  ```

- Add `Program Files\tanzu` to your PATH.

#### Legacy method to install plugins (with API-driven plugin discovery deactivated)

Users can still install the plugins using the legacy method by deactivating the `context-aware-cli-for-plugins` feature.

<details><summary>Installation steps</summary>

#### macOS/Linux

- Deactivate API-driven plugin discovery

  ```sh
  tanzu config set features.global.context-aware-cli-for-plugins false
  ```

- If you have a previous version of tanzu CLI already installed and the config file ~/.config/tanzu/config.yaml is present, run this command to make sure the default plugin repo points to the right path.

  ```sh
  tanzu plugin repo update -b tanzu-cli-framework core
  ```

- Install the downloaded plugins

  ```sh
  tanzu plugin install --local tanzu/cli all
  ```

- Verify the installed plugins

  ```sh
  tanzu plugin list
  ```

#### Windows

- Save following in `install.bat` in current directory and run `install.bat`

  Note: Replace `v0.14.0` (line number 3) with the version you've downloaded.

  ```sh
  SET TANZU_CLI_DIR=%ProgramFiles%\tanzu
  mkdir "%TANZU_CLI_DIR%"
  copy /B /Y cli\core\v0.14.0\tanzu-core-windows_amd64.exe "%TANZU_CLI_DIR%\tanzu.exe"
  set PATH=%PATH%;%TANZU_CLI_DIR%
  SET PLUGIN_DIR=%LocalAppData%\tanzu-cli
  mkdir %PLUGIN_DIR%
  SET TANZU_CACHE_DIR=%LocalAppData%\.cache\tanzu
  rmdir /Q /S %TANZU_CACHE_DIR%

  tanzu config set features.global.context-aware-cli-for-plugins false
  tanzu plugin repo update -b tanzu-cli-framework core
  tanzu plugin install --local cli all

  tanzu plugin list
  ```

- Add `Program Files\tanzu` to your PATH.

</details>

## Delete a selected plugin

If you want to delete a given plugin (one use case is when a plugin has become obsolete), you can run the following command:

```sh
tanzu plugin delete <PLUGIN_NAME>
```

With `v0.11.0` release, the plugin `imagepullsecret` is deprecated and renamed `secret`. The new plugin `secret` will be installed following
the instructions listed above. Remove the installed deprecated plugin if it exists using:

```sh
tanzu plugin delete imagepullsecret
```

## Build the CLI and plugins from source

If you want the very latest, you can also build and install tanzu CLI, and its plugins, from source.

### Prerequisites

- [go](https://golang.org/dl/) version 1.17

- Clone Tanzu Framework and run the below command to build and install CLI and
  plugins locally for your platform.

  ```sh
  make build-install-cli-local
  ```

- When the build is done, the tanzu CLI binary and the plugins will be produced locally in the `artifacts` directory.
  The CLI binary will be in a directory similar to the following:

  ```bash
  ./artifacts/<OS>/<ARCH>/cli/core/<version>/tanzu-core-<os_arch>
  ```

- For instance, the following is a build for MacOS:

  ```bash
  ./artifacts/darwin/amd64/cli/core/latest/tanzu-core-darwin_amd64
  ```

- If you additionally want to build and install CLI and plugins for all platforms, run:

  ```sh
  make build-install-cli-all
  ```

The CLI has 2 different types of plugins.

  1. Standalone plugins: independent of the CLI context
  2. Context(server) scoped plugins: scoped to one or more contexts

When building the CLI locally and installing plugins with `make build-install-cli-local` or `make build-install-cli-all`, the `local` file-system based standalone plugin discovery and distribution is used. While building locally all plugins are treated as standalone plugins. The type of discovery which gets used is determined by `DISCOVERY_TYPE` variable that configures `pkg/v1/config.DefaultStandaloneDiscoveryType` variable while building the Tanzu CLI. Please check `build-cli-%` target under the [Makefile](./Makefile)

However, for official release, which uses OCI image based plugin discovery and distribution, `cluster` and `kubernetes-release` are context scoped plugins whereas `login`, `management-cluster`, `package` and `secret` are considered standalone plugins. Users can run `tanzu plugin list` command to check the plugin's scope and discovery information.
All admin plugins like `builder`, `test` etc. are also considered standalone plugins.

More details about this can be found in [context-aware plugin discovery](docs/design/context-aware-plugin-discovery-design.md) design document.

```

## Creating clusters

Tanzu CLI allows you to create clusters on a variety of infrastructure platforms
such as vSphere, Azure, AWS and on Docker.

1. Initialize the Tanzu kickstart UI by running the below command to create the
management cluster.

   ```sh
   tanzu management-cluster create --ui
   ```

   The above would open a management cluster provisioning UI and you can select the
   deployment infrastructure and create the cluster.

1. To validate the creation of the management cluster

   ```sh
   tanzu management-cluster get
   ```

1. Get the management cluster's kubeconfig

   ```sh
   tanzu management-cluster kubeconfig get ${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME} --admin
   ```

1. Set kubectl context

   ```sh
   kubectl config use-context ${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME}-admin@${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME}
   ```

1. Next create the workload cluster

   1. Create a new workload clusterconfig file by copying the management cluster config file
      `~/.config/tanzu/tkg/clusterconfigs/<MGMT-CONFIG-FILE>` and changing the `CLUSTER_NAME` parameter
      to the workload cluster name, you can also edit other parameters as required.
   1. Create workload cluster

      ```sh
      tanzu cluster create ${WORKLOAD_CLUSTER_NAME} --file ~/.config/tanzu/tkg/clusterconfigs/workload.yaml
      ```

   1. Validate workload cluster creation

      ```sh
      tanzu cluster list
      ```

1. Do cool things with the provisioned clusters.
1. Clean up

   1. To delete workload cluster

      ```sh
      tanzu cluster delete ${WORKLOAD_CLUSTER_NAME}
      ```

      Management cluster can only be deleted after deleting all the workload clusters.

   1. To delete management cluster

      ```sh
      tanzu management-cluster delete ${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME}
      ```

## What's next

Tanzu CLI is built to be extensible, if you wish to extend Tanzu CLI, you can do
that by writing your CLI plugins.

### Create your own plugin

To bootstrap a new plugin, follow the `builder` plugin documentation [here](../../cmd/cli/plugin-admin/builder/README.md).

Check out the [plugin implementation guide](../../cli/core/docs/cli/plugin_implementation_guide.md) for more details.
