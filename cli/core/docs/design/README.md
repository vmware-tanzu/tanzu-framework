# Design Proposals

This directory is to be populated with design reviews.

Use the [Proposal Template](../../../../docs/dev/_proposal.md) as a starting point.

The proposal should be documented as a separated markdown in this directory via PR.

The name should follow the name pattern `<short meaningful words joined by '-'>-design.md`,
e.g: `restore-hooks-design.md`.
