        #  - profile

        #  - groups

        # Some providers return claims without "email_verified", when they had no usage of emails verification in enrollment process

        insecureSkipEmailVerified: true

        # Groups claims (like the rest of oidc claims through dex) only refresh when the id token is refreshed
        # meaning the regular refresh flow doesn't update the groups claim. As such by default the oidc connector
        # doesn't allow groups claims. If you are okay with having potentially stale group claims you can use
        # this option to enable groups claims through the oidc connector on a per-connector basis.
        # This can be overridden with the below option
        # insecureEnableGroups: true

        # When enabled, the OpenID Connector will query the UserInfo endpoint for additional claims. UserInfo claims
        # take priority over claims returned by the IDToken. This option should be used when the IDToken doesn't contain
        # all the claims requested.

        # promptType: consent

        # Some providers return non-standard claims (eg. mail).
        # Use claimMapping to map those claims to standard claims:
        # https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims
        # claimMapping can only map a non-standard claim to a standard one if it's not returned in the id_token.
