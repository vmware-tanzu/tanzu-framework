                The Feature resource specified may or may not be present in the system.
                If the Feature is present, the FeatureGate controller and webhook
                sets the specified activation state only if the Feature is discoverable
                and its immutability constraint is satisfied. If the Feature is not
                present, the activation intent is applied when the Feature resource
                appears in the system. The actual activation state of the Feature
                is reported in the status.
