                    the most recent distribution matching the hint will be selected.
                    \n The version selected based on the hint will be stored in the

                    used if the cluster is scaled out in the future. \n VersionHint
                    is a semantic prefix of a full version number. (E.g., v1.15.1
                    matches any distribution of v1.15.1, including v1.15.1+vmware.1-tkg.1

                    A hint that does not match the full version is invalid and will
                    be rejected. \n To upgrade a cluster to the most recent version
                    that still matches the hint, leave the hint alone and remove the
                    fullVersion from the spec. This will cause the hint to be re-resolved."
